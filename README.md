 Acerola Game Jam

#### General Premise
You are a bicyclist running from cars except the cars are monsters?
Survive as guys spawn and try to blow up/shoot/smash you for as long as you can


#### Player controller
Kinematic player controller - For now mostly finished. Still unideal tilting behavior, but oh well.
